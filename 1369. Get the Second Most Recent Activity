There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
This table contains information about the activity performed by each user in a period of time.
A person with username performed an activity from startDate to endDate.
 

Write an SQL query to show the second most recent activity of each user.

If the user only has one activity, return that one. A user cannot perform more than one activity at the same time.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
UserActivity table:

Explanation: 
The most recent activity of Alice is Travel from 2020-02-24 to 2020-02-28, before that she was dancing from 2020-02-21 to 2020-02-23.
Bob only has one record, we just take that one.

with cte as(
        select username, count(username) as num
        from UserActivity 
         group by username
    ),
     checkActivityNumber as(
        select a.username as name, a.activity as act, a.startDate as sd, a.endDate as ed, b.num
            from UserActivity a left join cte b
                on a.username = b.username
    ),
    rankActivity as(
        select name, act, sd, ed, num, rank()over(
            partition by name order by sd desc) as rnk
            from checkActivityNumber    
    )
select name as username, act as activity, sd as startDate, ed as endDate
    from rankActivity
    where rnk =2
union
select name as username, act as activity, sd as startDate, ed as endDate
    from rankActivity
    where rnk =1 and num =1
